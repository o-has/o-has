### What am I doing here??? 🤷‍♀️

I'm o-has! I joined Github in 2024 as I have become interested in coding and AI, and at the time of writing I'm studying on the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp learning Python and Data Analysis.
- 🔭 In my spare time I'm working on Automation programmes and APIs with LLMs 
- 💬 Ask me about London, Lisbon, Granada, Melbourne, Whistler, California, Indonesia, Brazil!
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't want to put emails here for fear of spambots so just send me a message through here and we can swap contacts!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning new things, and I love goats!
